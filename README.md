## Notes

You can navigate directly to a profile page by visiting `/profile/1`. Once there, you can attempt to edit a profile by clicking the "Edit" button. Updating a profile will update the user data saved at `/public/people.json`. We can discuss deeper implementation  details synchronously. There are many areas where the code could be improved, which we can also chat about! Thank you for your review.
